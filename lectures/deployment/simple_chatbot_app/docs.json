Now, I'm not a total idiot, but I'm also not exactly a genius, and at the time I closed the site and wrote it off as inaccurate.\n\nThinking back on it, I remember it telling me to pay something like \u00a360 pounds for a certificate in order to 'prove' I had a 150-something IQ, and that was probably why the result was so high. No one's going to pay money to be told they have an IQ of 60. \n\nSo in conclusion, I think the reason so many internet idiots have ridiculously high IQs is due to both their enormous egos and not being bright enough to realise they've been scammed.\n\nTL,DR: take IQ tests on the internet with a grain of salt.", "YSK: you can replace your social security number card up to 3 times a year with a limit of 10 times in your lifetime.

The oil can cause painful, itchy, and weeping rashes and wounds. While many people know to steer clear of the poisonous plants, they might not know that they should handle mangos with caution. \n\nIf you're picking mangos, wear gloves and long sleeves.

Just don't mention discounts or cut corners. Why YSK:\n\n\n 1. it makes your life better to have them put in the extra effort to be nice to you, so it's nice to make their life better. Usually they don't see a ton of reward.\n\n\n 2. it costs you nothing to call, and only 5 minutes of time usually. \n\n\n 3. It's a powerful statement, because people usually just call to complain. A compliment speaks loudly. \n\n\n 4. It's good for the businesses too, to have workers that are pleasant. Everyone benefits from them rewarding solid and friendly employees. \n\n\nTip: don't mention them giving you discounts etc. Do mention the solid experience they provided you as a customer, and how friendly they were.", "LPT: Trying to type faster?

It may seem to you that you did your best and want to get over it quickly, while those partial points can be quite valuable. There's a chance that you'll understand the question after reading it once again, or that you possibly misread it the first time.
